# C# Zero→Hero (Console Edition)

**C# Zero→Hero (Console Edition)** is a beginner-friendly course designed to take you from zero to building working console applications with **.NET 9** and **Visual Studio Code**.

This course is **visual-first**:  
- Almost no terminal commands (everything runs from the VS Code UI).  
- Step-by-step lessons with guided exercises and short exams.  
- Each module comes with **before/after code**, **cheat sheets**, and **test instructions**.

## Who This Course Is For
- Complete beginners with little or no coding experience.  
- High school or college students starting programming.  
- Anyone who prefers clear, practical explanations with lots of hands-on practice.

## Learning Path

By the end of this course, you will be able to:  
- Understand the fundamentals of the C# language.  
- Write, debug, and run console apps.  
- Apply concepts such as variables, loops, methods, collections, error handling, and OOP.  
- Use features like enums, tuples, records, LINQ, and basic file handling.  
- Build a **Final Project (Habit Tracker)** that ties everything together.
